class QgsGeometry
{
%Docstring
A geometry is the spatial representation of a feature. Since QGIS 2.10, QgsGeometry acts as a generic container
for geometry objects. QgsGeometry is implicitly shared, so making copies of geometries is inexpensive. The geometry
container class can also be stored inside a QVariant object.

The actual geometry representation is stored as a QgsAbstractGeometry within the container, and
can be accessed via the get() method or set using the set() method.

The ``azimuth`` gives the angle (in degrees) for the middle of the wedge to point.
The buffer width (in degrees) is specified by the ``angularWidth`` parameter. Note that the
wedge will extend to half of the ``angularWidth`` either side of the ``azimuth`` direction.

The outer radius of the buffer is specified via ``outerRadius``, and optionally an
``innerRadius`` can also be specified.

    bool equals( const QgsGeometry &geometry ) const;
%Docstring
Test if this geometry is exactly equal to another ``geometry``.

This is a strict equality check, where the underlying geometries must
have exactly the same type, component vertices and vertex order.

Calling this method is dramatically faster than the topological
equality test performed by isGeosEqual().

Compares the geometry with another geometry using GEOS.

This method performs a slow, topological check, where geometries
are considered equal if all of the their component edges overlap. E.g.
lines with the same vertex locations but opposite direction will be
considered equal by this method.

Consider using the much faster, stricter equality test performed
by equals() instead.

    QgsVertexIterator vertices() const;
%Docstring
Returns a read-only, Java-style iterator for traversal of vertices of all the geometry, including all geometry parts and rings.

.. warning::

   The iterator returns a copy of individual vertices, and accordingly geometries cannot be
   modified using the iterator. See transformVertices() for a safe method to modify vertices "in-place".

* Example:
.. code-block:: python

       # print the x and y coordinate for each vertex in a LineString
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'LineString( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )
       for v in geometry.vertices():
           print(v.x(), v.y())

       # vertex iteration includes all parts and rings

.. seealso:: :py:func:`parts`

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End


    QgsGeometryPartIterator parts();
%Docstring
Returns Java-style iterator for traversal of parts of the geometry. This iterator
can safely be used to modify parts of the geometry.

This method forces a detach. Use constParts() to avoid the detach
if the parts are not going to be modified.

* Example:
.. code-block:: python

       # print the WKT representation of each part in a multi-point geometry
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )
       for part in geometry.parts():
           print(part.asWkt())

       # single part geometries only have one part - this loop will iterate once only
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'LineString( 0 0, 10 10 )' )
       for part in geometry.parts():
           print(part.asWkt())

       # parts can be modified during the iteration
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )
       for part in geometry.parts():
           part.transform(ct)

       # part iteration can also be combined with vertex iteration
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPolygon((( 0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 0, 0 0 ),( 5 5, 5 6, 6 6, 6 5, 5 5)),((20 2, 22 2, 22 4, 20 4, 20 2)))' )

.. versionadded:: 3.6
%End

    QgsGeometryConstPartIterator constParts() const;
%Docstring
Returns Java-style iterator for traversal of parts of the geometry. This iterator
returns read-only references to parts and cannot be used to modify the parts.

Unlike parts(), this method does not force a detach and is more efficient if read-only
iteration only is required.

* Example:
.. code-block:: python

       # print the WKT representation of each part in a multi-point geometry
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )

    double hausdorffDistance( const QgsGeometry &geom ) const;
%Docstring
Returns the Hausdorff distance between this geometry and ``geom``. This is basically a measure of how similar or dissimilar 2 geometries are.

This algorithm is an approximation to the standard Hausdorff distance. This approximation is exact or close enough for a large
subset of useful cases. Examples of these are:

- computing distance between Linestrings that are roughly parallel to each other,
and roughly equal in length. This occurs in matching linear networks.
- Testing similarity of geometries.

If the default approximate provided by this method is insufficient, use hausdorffDistanceDensify() instead.

In case of error -1 will be returned.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`hausdorffDistanceDensify`

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End

    double hausdorffDistanceDensify( const QgsGeometry &geom, double densifyFraction ) const;
%Docstring
Returns the Hausdorff distance between this geometry and ``geom``. This is basically a measure of how similar or dissimilar 2 geometries are.

This function accepts a ``densifyFraction`` argument. The function performs a segment
densification before computing the discrete Hausdorff distance. The ``densifyFraction`` parameter
sets the fraction by which to densify each segment. Each segment will be split into a
number of equal-length subsegments, whose fraction of the total length is
closest to the given fraction.

This method can be used when the default approximation provided by hausdorffDistance()
is not sufficient. Decreasing the ``densifyFraction`` parameter will make the
distance returned approach the true Hausdorff distance for the geometries.

In case of error -1 will be returned.

    void adjacentVertices( int atVertex, int &beforeVertex /Out/, int &afterVertex /Out/ ) const;

Returns the indexes of the vertices before and after the given vertex index.

This function takes into account the following factors:

1. If the given vertex index is at the end of a linestring,
the adjacent index will be -1 (for "no adjacent vertex")
2. If the given vertex index is at the end of a linear ring
(such as in a polygon), the adjacent index will take into
account the first vertex is equal to the last vertex (and will
skip equal vertex positions).

angles either right angles or flat lines. This is an iterative algorithm which will loop until
either the vertices are within a specified tolerance of right angles or a set number of maximum

Returns a new geometry with all points or vertices snapped to the closest point of the grid.

If the gridified geometry could not be calculated (or was totally collapsed) an empty geometry will be returned.
Note that snapping to grid may generate an invalid geometry in some corner cases.
It can also be thought as rounding the edges and it may be useful for removing errors.

    bool removeDuplicateNodes( double epsilon = 4 * DBL_EPSILON, bool useZValues = false );
%Docstring
Removes duplicate nodes from the geometry, wherever removing the nodes does not result in a
degenerate geometry.

The ``epsilon`` parameter specifies the tolerance for coordinates when determining that
vertices are identical.

By default, z values are not considered when detecting duplicate nodes. E.g. two nodes
with the same x and y coordinate but different z values will still be considered
duplicate and one will be removed. If ``useZValues`` is true, then the z values are
also tested and nodes with the same x and y but different z will be maintained.

Note that duplicate nodes are not tested between different parts of a multipart geometry. E.g.
a multipoint geometry with overlapping points will not be changed by this method.

The function will return true if nodes were removed, or false if no duplicate nodes
were found.

Densifies the geometry by adding regularly placed extra nodes inside each segment
so that the maximum distance between any two nodes does not exceed the
specified ``distance``.
E.g. specifying a distance 3 would cause the segment [0 0] -> [10 0]
to be converted to [0 0] -> [2.5 0] -> [5 0] -> [7.5 0] -> [10 0], since
3 extra nodes are required on the segment and spacing these at 2.5 increments
allows them to be evenly spaced over the segment.

not be valid and may contain self-intersections.

The minimum allowed value for ``maxNodes`` is 8.

In case of full or partial dimensional collapses, the output geometry may be a collection
of lower-to-equal dimension geometries or a geometry of lower dimension.
Single polygons may become multi-geometries in case of self-intersections.
It preserves Z values, but M values will be dropped.

If an error was encountered during the process, more information can be retrieved
by calling `error()` on the returned geometry.

:return: new valid QgsGeometry or null geometry on error

.. note::

   Ported from PostGIS ST_MakeValid() and it should return equivalent results.

    QgsGeometry forceRHR() const;
%Docstring
Forces geometries to respect the Right-Hand-Rule, in which the area that is bounded by a polygon
is to the right of the boundary. In particular, the exterior ring is oriented in a clockwise direction
and the interior rings in a counter-clockwise direction.

    static QgsGeometry unaryUnion( const QVector<QgsGeometry> &geometries );
%Docstring
Compute the unary union on a list of ``geometries``. May be faster than an iterative union on a set of geometries.
The returned geometry will be fully noded, i.e. a node will be created at every common intersection of the
input geometries. An empty geometry will be returned in the case of errors.
%End

    static QgsGeometry polygonize( const QVector<QgsGeometry> &geometries );
%Docstring
Creates a GeometryCollection geometry containing possible polygons formed from the constituent
linework of a set of ``geometries``. The input geometries must be fully noded (i.e. nodes exist
at every common intersection of the geometries). The easiest way to ensure this is to first
call unaryUnion() on the set of input geometries and then pass the result to polygonize().
An empty geometry will be returned in the case of errors.

%Docstring
Smooths a geometry by rounding off corners using the Chaikin algorithm. This operation
roughly doubles the number of vertices in a geometry.

If input geometries contain Z or M values, these will also be smoothed and the output
geometry will retain the same dimensionality as the input geometry.

:param iterations: number of smoothing iterations to run. More iterations results
                   in a smoother geometry
:param offset: fraction of line to create new vertices along, between 0 and 1.0,
               e.g., the default value of 0.25 will create new vertices 25% and 75% along each line segment
               of the geometry for each iteration. Smaller values result in "tighter" smoothing.
:param minimumDistance: minimum segment length to apply smoothing to
:param maxAngle: maximum angle at node (0-180) at which smoothing will be applied
